======================================

In this project I have built a watchface for Sunshine app.

1) app module - It contains the main source code for Sunshine android app

2) watch module- It contains the source code for Sunshine watchface for Android wear.





Complete these steps to update Sunshine to use an API key:

2) Add the line below to your ~/.gradle/gradle.properties file (create the file if it does not exist already): MyOpenWeatherMapApiKey=”YOUR_API_KEY”

3) Follow this guide to add json file for google services plugin
